# YelpCamp
A web application I created using Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/.

I am currently remaking this project using concepts and techniques I have learned over the past year. Stay tuned for updates!  

## Features: 
- Full CRUD functionality

## TODO:

- About page
- Dark mode
- New color palette
